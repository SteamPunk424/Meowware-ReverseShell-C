# Meowware-ReverseShell-C
A Linux Reverse Shell Program written in C that drops random cat.txt files and fills them with cat nonsense whenever a command is run \
through the reverse shell. \
Edit the callback IP and Port and then compile with: \
```gcc MeowWare.c -o MeowWare```
\
\
\
\
This is based off of the reverse shell found at: \
